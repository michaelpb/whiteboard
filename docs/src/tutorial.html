        <h3>Two ways of creating decks</h3>

        <p>Each presentation is called a <em>deck</em>. You have two
        routes for creating decks:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>GUI: You can create new decks entirely with the GUI, by
            clicking on the <strong>NEW DECK</strong> button on first
            screen. After you choose a location and filename to save, you
            are good to go with your first slide-show.</li>

            <li>Text: by editing the <code>.whiteboard</code> plain-text
            file-format. If you are more at home in a text editor, this
            might be the fastest. <a href="#fileformat">Click here to learn
            how to do this.</a></li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Using Whiteboard</h3>

        <p><strong>Menus:</strong> Whiteboard is entirely controlled by the
        application menu and the context menu (using <em>Right click</em> or
        <em>Ctrl + Click</em>). The context menu is different depending on
        where you click, so if you right-click on the Editor, for example, you
        will have options to save the current file open in the editor.</p>

        <p><strong>Shortcuts:</strong> Most menu actions have also a shortcut
        key assigned. Like the context menu, the available shortcuts change
        depending on which pane you are using. For example: for the editor
        <code>Ctrl+S</code> will save the open file, and for the browser,
        <code>Ctrl+R</code> will hard-refresh. To see the list of all available
        shortcuts, hit F1.</p>

        <p><strong>Slide editing:</strong> Using the menu, or <code>F2</code>,
        you can create, edit, delete, and re-arrange slides. Create a slide for
        each activity you want to demo, and add an editor, terminal, markdown
        text, or browser as appropriate for each slide. When you are done, be
        sure to save from the <code>File</code> menu.</p>

        <h3>Presenting with Whiteboard</h4>

        <p><strong>Saving and organizing presentations:</strong> A reasonable
        way to organize your presentations is to have each slide or group of
        slides have it's own directory, with relevant files about each topic
        within it. Then, you can set up editors, browsers, terminals, and
        explanatory text as needed for each slide to go through a series of
        activities.  Whiteboard's simple plain-text format makes it easy to
        create and share presentations via git or an archive file. Sharing
        ahead of time even allows participants to follow along. <a
        target="_blank" href="https://github.com/michaelpb/whiteboard-tutorial-processing-data-with-nodejs">See
        this self-guided tutorial as an example.</a></p>

        <p><strong>Presentation Mode:</strong> Unlike other slide show
        applications, Whiteboard was designed with improvisation as a primary
        focus. Thus, it does not separate a GUI or Editing mode from it's
        presentation mode. Presentation Mode causes Whiteboard to go
        full-screen, but still offers the same keyboard shortcuts and context
        menu as before.  This makes it easy to have a nice presentation even
        without going to full-screen, and to change or edit slides in the
        middle of a presentation.</p>

        <p><strong>Directing focus during presentations:</strong> During a
        presentation, using the menu or <code>F10</code> you can maximize an
        individual pane.  This state is saved, so you can leave certain panes
        maximized to hide other content. A useful technique is  to leave your
        slide titles all maximized, which gives time to give a verbal
        introduction to the topic without the distraction of code or browser on
        the screen, and then unmaximize it when you are ready to plunge in.</p>

        <h3>The Whiteboard file format</h3>
        <p>The decks are stored in a plaintext format that resembles INI files,
        with the extension `.whiteboard`.  The format is simple and convenient
        enough to edit by hand.

        <div class="columns">
            <div class="column">
                <h5>Accepted values in slides</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>title</strong> - a bold title at the top of the
                    slide</li>

                    <li><strong>browser</strong> - consists of a web-browser
                    that can be pointed to a remote HTTP address (starting with
                    <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code>) or local
                    HTML file (starting with <code>file://</code>).</li>

                    <li><strong>editor</strong> - can edit multiple code files
                    in tabs with syntax highlighting, consisting of comma (or
                    new-line) separated of relative or absolute file paths.
                    Wild cards / glob syntax is accepted.</li>

                    <li><strong>terminal</strong> - bash terminal, specify a
                    starting directory</li>

                    <li><strong>markdown</strong> - multi-line element to
                    contain arbitrary explanatory text</li>

                    <li><em>maximize</em> - the value should be one of the
                    above pane types, causing that pane be maximized at the
                    start (useful while introducing a topic to avoid having
                    unrelated or distracting text until the time comes)</li>

                    <li><em>layout</em> - layout of the slide, the value should
                    be one "horizontal", "vertical", or "grid"</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>Syntax</h5>
                <p>
                The Whiteboard format consists of lines of <code>[slide]</code>
                followed by key/value pairs in the format of <code>key = value</code>,
                each on a new line. For multi-line values, you can use the syntax
                <code>key : ''' (... multiple lines of text ...) '''</code>. The only
                requirement is that the final <code>'''</code> is alone on its own
                line.
                </p>
                <h5>Example</h5>

editor=./POST_python/*.py

[slide]
title=Demo of final app
browser = ./POST_challenge/index.html
markdown : '''

- Hint: You'll have to use a POST endpoint
